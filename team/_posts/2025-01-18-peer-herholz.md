Peer Herholz is a Research Assistant Professor at Northwestern University, director of the [SPARK initiative](https://spark-csd.github.io/) and a member of the [Cognitive Science](https://cogsci.northwestern.edu/) and [Interdepartmental Neuroscience program](https://www.nuin.northwestern.edu/), as well as [AI@Northwestern](https://ai.northwestern.edu/). 

His research comprises two main topics.  The first, entails the neurobiology of auditory processing as a model mechanism of complex biological behavior. The seconds builds upon the integration of computational and conceptual models to investigate generalization in biological and artificial agents and the potentially underlying transformations as a basis for intelligent adaptive behavior. He addresses these questions using MRI, EEG, behavior and artificial neural networks, with a special emphasis on data analysis approaches (e.g., pattern analyses, multimodal data integration, naturalistic paradigms, alignment methods & statistical learning) as open, transparent and reproducible as possible. 

He's furthermore highly invested in everything related to analyses and methods within the realm of neuroinformatics, open & reproducible (neuro)science, education & outreach, fair access & utilization of knowledge, as well as responsible & sustainable science. He's combining all of the above by organizing and conducting workshops, hackathons and lectures/talks, supervising students, supporting researchers at all career levels and trying to establish/push standards across different levels (labs, institutes, universities etc.) by being an active part in a versatile set of communities.
