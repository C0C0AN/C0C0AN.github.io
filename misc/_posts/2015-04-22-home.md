The `Cognition and Computation in AI and Neuroscience (CoCoAN)` team is a collection of individuals working at the intersection of AI, neuroscience and neuroinformatics, based at [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu) in Chicago/Evanston.

The `CoCoAN` team uses a combination of computational and neuroscientific approaches (including behavior, neuroimaging, genes, simulations, etc.) to study adaptive intelligent behavior of biological and artificial agents. A lot of our work focuses on auditory processing as a model mechanism.

All of this is guided by `open science` principles and practices to promote reproducible research results. For more information, please check the [research page]() or the team's [GitHub](https://github.com/C0C0AN).
