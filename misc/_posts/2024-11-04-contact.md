The `Cognition and Computation in AI and Neuroscience (CoCoAN)` team is always looking for interested students and personnel.

**We are currently only recruiting rotation students for the 2024-2025 academic year.**

More information on our training opportunities can be found below.

# Postdocs

Individuals interested in joining the team as a postdoc, either directly or via co-supervision/collaboration should reach out directly to Peer Herholz ([peer.herholz@northwestern.edu](mailto:peer.herholz@northwestern.edu)) with a brief overview of the planned work. If we currently have dedicated openings, you'll find them below.

# Graduate Students

As we're working with and across different departments and programs, we currently accept students from 
several respective fields. This includes: [Doctor of Audiology](https://aud.northwestern.edu/), [PhD in Communication Sciences and Disorders](https://phdcsd.northwestern.edu/), [Interdepartmental Neuroscience PhD](https://www.nuin.northwestern.edu/), [MS in Speech, Language and Learning](https://mssll.northwestern.edu/) and [Cognitive Science](https://cogsci.northwestern.edu/). Students from other departments/programs are welcome too but we would need to discuss co-supervision, etc. .

In any case, please reach out directly to Peer Herholz ([peer.herholz@northwestern.edu](mailto:peer.herholz@northwestern.edu)) with a brief overview of the planned work.

**For PhD programs: Please note that we're only accepting rotation students at this point as we can't support full PhD students yet.**

# Undergraduate Students

As we're working with and across different departments and programs, we currently accept students from 
several respective fields. This includes: [Communication Sciencees and Disorders](https://communication.northwestern.edu/academics/communication-sciences-and-disorders/), [Neuroscience](https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/sites/neuroscience/index.html), [Computer Science](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/), [Statistics and Data Science](https://statistics.northwestern.edu/undergraduate/data_science_major/) and [Cognitive Science](https://cogsci.northwestern.edu/). Students from other departments/programs are welcome too but we would need to discuss co-supervision, etc. .

Undergraduate students working in the `CoCoAN` team may contribute to one of several ongoing projects. These research activities may include assisting with literature searches, and/or the collection, processing, analysis of data (behavior, neuroimaging, genes, simulations, etc.), or various computational work (e.g. programming, software development, etc.). As this typically necessitates extensive training, a commitment of at least 2 quarters is needed to take full advantage of these research opportunities. Such training is geared to those students who wish to pursue graduate training in the field of cognitive and computational (neuro)science, as well as AI.

We usually have [URAP](https://undergradresearch.northwestern.edu/urap/) and/or [work-study](https://undergradaid.northwestern.edu/work-study/) positions available.
In any case, please reach out directly to Peer Herholz ([peer.herholz@northwestern.edu](mailto:peer.herholz@northwestern.edu)) with a brief overview of the planned work.
