ALPACA is a toolbox (and hopefully soon BIDS app) for the localization and parcellation of human auditory cortex areas. In more detail, it includes an anatomical and a functional processing pipeline (implemented in nipype) that can be run alone or in combination. While the first just needs an anatomical image and takes advantage of FreeSurfer and ANTs, effectively mapping a user specified list of auditory cortex regions from template to native space, the latter makes use of different classic tonotopy experiments that also come with the toolbox and therefore requires functional data. Furthermore, it includes a set of tutorials, ranging from data management and preparation over stimulus generation to ROI extraction. Beside being a hopefully helpful tool, ALPACA also intends to further increase standardization and reproducibility, by e.g., uploading anonymized results to an interactive online repository, allowing for large scale meta-analysis. This online repository furthermore summarizes the vast multitude of approaches and the resulting regions of interest in an interactive, open and reproducible way.
